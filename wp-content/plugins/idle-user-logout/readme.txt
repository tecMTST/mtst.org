Go and configure the time period whatever you like from your admin end general settings page.

It\'s in milliseconds, so 2 seconds is equal to 2000 ms of idle time.

It isn\'t possible. The plugin does some validation, which force user to set idle time minimum 10. If left blank, it will take default time mentioned in General Settings tab.
